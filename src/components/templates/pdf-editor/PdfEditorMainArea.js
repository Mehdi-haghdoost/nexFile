                            I've been in the web design business since 1998. It has gone through some phases, but the place its at right now feels the weirdest in a long time.

                            <br />
                            For years UX designers battled the "dribbblization" of the industry. What it means, is creating eye-candy projects and posing them as serious work.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Beautiful at first glance, but either impossible to code, or completely dysfunctional.

                            What is the role of a website? 99% of the time it's to sell something. To get you to click a button.

                            Beautiful background with mountains and a person gazing into the distance doesn't sell. Sure, it tickles your sense of aesthetics. I'll give you that.

                            But on its own that's only a piece of artwork. Nothing more.
